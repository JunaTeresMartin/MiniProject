PAALAN

Paalan is an online platform for Anganwadis. We have a lot of Aganwadis near us, but we are not able to access them. There are a lot of schemes related to Anganwadi that are beneficial for everyone, but not everybody is able to access them. It's because of the lack of communication. In order to reduce this issue, we came up with a solution called Paalan.
Paalan helps in managing stock and admissions related to Anganwadi and helps in communicating with people about the new schemes. It will contain information about the stock availability in each Anganwadi in each location, it will be useful for the local government bodies regarding the supply needs information. It will help them recognize the
stock that is not being utilized and identify the region where there is a lack of stock and transport the balance or extra stock into that particular region.
